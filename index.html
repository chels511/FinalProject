			<p>Developed systematic densitization- a behavior therapy that occurs in three steps.The first step is to identify the hierarchy of fears. The second step is to learn relaxation or coping techniques. Finally, the individual uses these techniques to manage their fear during a situation from the hierarchy. </p>

			<h1>Sexual Desensitization</h1>
			<p>Sexual desensitization from pornography refers to a phenomenon where individuals, after prolonged exposure to explicit sexual content, may experience a diminished response or sensitivity to sexual stimuli. Research indicates that porn consumers can become desensitized to porn, often needing to consume more porn, more extreme forms of porn, or consume porn more often in order to get the same response they once did.</p>

            </label>
			<h1>Emotional/Empathy Desensitization</h1>
			<p>Overexposure to emotionally charged content, such as tragic news stories or dramatic portrayals of suffering, may desensitize individuals to feelings of empathy or emotional resonance. This could result in decreased emotional reactions or concern for others' distress.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="types-col">
			<label class="custom-checkbox">
            <input type="checkbox">
            <span class="checkmark"></span>
            </label>
			<h1>Social Media Desensitization</h1>
			<p> Constant exposure to curated or exaggerated portrayals of lifestyles, achievements, or body image on social media platforms can desensitize individuals to reality, leading to feelings of inadequacy, comparison, or desensitization to others' emotions or experiences.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="types-col">
			<label class="custom-checkbox">
            <input type="checkbox">
            <span class="checkmark"></span>
            </label>
			<h1>Violence Desensitization</h1>
			<p>Exposure to violent content in movies, video games, or news media can desensitize individuals to violence. This might lead to decreased emotional reactions or empathy toward violent acts, making it seem more acceptable or less shocking. Research also belives it may be incorporated into our actions and behavior.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="types-col">
			<label class="custom-checkbox">
            <input type="checkbox">
            <span class="checkmark"></span>
            </label>
			<h1>Sensory Densensitization</h1>
			<p>Continuous exposure to certain sensory experiences in media, such as loud noises, bright flashing lights, or intense visual effects in movies or video games, can desensitize individuals to those specific sensory stimuli. Over time, this may reduce the sensitivity or responsiveness to such sensory input.</p>

		<div class="types-col">
			<label class="custom-checkbox">
            <input type="checkbox">
            <span class="checkmark"></span>
            </label>
			<h1>Risk Densensitization</h1>
			<p>Exposure to media representations of risky behaviors, extreme stunts, or dangerous activities (e.g., in movies, reality shows, social media) might desensitize individuals to the associated risks. This could lead to underestimating the dangers or consequences of such behaviors in real life.</p>
